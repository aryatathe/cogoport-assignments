# Assignment 1 (UI/UX) Solution

## Website 1: [https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/)

1. On mobile screens, the search bar flows out of the header when active, and the placeholder flows out of the whole input area as well. The placeholder text feels too large as well, so the element itself should be more responsive and resize appropriately with screen width.

2. The navigation bar buttons star overlapping before the navbar is removed to an expandable version at 1200px. Higher than that, the spacing / size / layout should be modified so the content is legible on the screen sizes of 1200 - 1300px. Alternatively, it can be switched to the expandable version at a screen width higher than 1200px;

3. The elements in this carousel section are inconsistent with each other and from other similar ones on the page

   1. The ratio between the blue button and the textbox beside it is uneven. It can be easily fixed since the long blue button is harder to read and can have its content text-wrapped to 2-3 lines.
   2. The buttons do not turn yellow when hovering, while every other button with the samme design on the page does so, which is inconsistent and unintuitive design.

4. When hovering over these cards, the background image zooms in, leading the user to belive it is a. However, the whole card is not clickable and doesn't change the cursor to a pointer either. Only the small "Read More" is clickable, which is unintuitive since it is not differently colored, sized, or spaced.

5. The statistics section is very cramped and looks very small especially on wider screens. It should have higher spacing from the elements above and below it to be prominent.

1.  The header is an unfixed element on the website and scrolls out of view very early. It should be fixed to the top of the screen so that the navigation links are accessible to the users and they don't have to scroll to the top each time.

2.  Clicking the search button on the header opens up a fullscreen overlay with just a search bar and a back button, which is excessive and unnecessary. The overlay could be either just the size of the header, or should have substantial transperancy even if is it fullscreen. Also, it should close when the user clicks away from the search bar.

3.  The icons on these banners are unevenly structured. The icons should have more margin from the text to their right, and all texts should be larger when taking the image sizes infto consideration. Ideally, the subheadings should be below the icons instead of beside them, which would be a more streamlined design.

4.  The date cards (right) are uneven. They should be designed to accomodate both single dates as well as date ranges, either by having different font sizes for each or a constant size for the card regardless of the content. Also, they seem to be differing in size even for single dates.

5.  The layout feels very uneven, the first two sections have column-oriented links while the bottom two have row-oriented ones. The latter ones feel too unnecessarily spaced apart, making the whole section very messy to look at and navigate.
