# Assignment 1 (UI/UX) Solution

1. On mobile screens, the search bar flows out of the header when active, and the placeholder flows out of the whole input area as well. The placeholder text feels too large as well, so the element itself should be more responsive and resize appropriately with screen width.

2. The navigation bar buttons star overlapping before the navbar is removed to an expandable version at 1200px. Higher than that, the spacing / size / layout should be modified so the content is legible on the screen sizes of 1200 - 1300px. Alternatively, it can be switched to the expandable version at a screen width higher than 1200px;

3. The elements in this carousel section are inconsistent with each other and from other similar ones on the page

   1. The ratio between the blue button and the textbox beside it is uneven. It can be easily fixed since the long blue button is harder to read and can have its content text-wrapped to 2-3 lines.
   2. The buttons do not turn yellow when hovering, while every other button with the samme design on the page does so, which is inconsistent and unintuitive design.

4. When hovering over these cards, the background image zooms in, leading the user to belive it is a. However, the whole card is not clickable and doesn't change the cursor to a pointer either. Only the small "Read More" is clickable, which is unintuitive since it is not differently colored, sized, or spaced.

5. The statistics section is very cramped and looks very small especially on wider screens. It should have higher spacing from the elements above and below it to be prominent.
